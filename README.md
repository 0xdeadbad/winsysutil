# Windows System Utilities

The purpose of this project is to offer an intuitive way to manage, visualize and monitor (where applicable) some Windows resources and services.

It's still work in progress, so here a TODO list (can change over time) of what is going to be developed and what to expect from it:

### TODO

- [x] Add an IPv4 address to an interface
- [ ] Remove an IPv4 address associated with an interface
- [x] Add routes
- [ ] Remove routes
- [x] Get routes from the routing table
- [x] Get the best route for an IPv4 address
- [ ] Working CLI prompt to interact with those features
